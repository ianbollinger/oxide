# Oxide
Oxide is an integrated development environment for the [Rust programming language](http://rust-lang.org) that runs on the [Eclipse](http://eclipse.org) platform. This project is in its infancy, so expect things not to work properly.

## Building
1. Ensure [Apache Maven 3](http://maven.apache.org) is installed.
2. Run `mvn` in the project's base directory.
3. Copy the contents of the `build/` subdirectory to your Eclipse `dropins/` directory.

See [build instructions](https://github.com/ianbollinger/oxide/wiki/Building-the-Oxide-plug-in) for additional information, like why building takes *forever*.

## Downloading
Copy the [plugin .jar](https://github.com/ianbollinger/oxide/downloads) to your Eclipse `dropins/` folder.
